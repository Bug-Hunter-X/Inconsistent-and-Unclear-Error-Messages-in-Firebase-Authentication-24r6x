This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to error handling in Firebase Authentication. The bug involves inconsistent and unclear error messages when authentication fails.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows how unexpected errors can occur, and the `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides a solution for handling these errors more gracefully and providing more informative feedback to the user.  The solution involves using more specific error checks and providing custom error messages to improve the user experience and simplify debugging.
