The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email or password is incorrect, or if the user is not found.  This can lead to difficulties in handling authentication failures gracefully in the application.  Additionally, the error messages returned are sometimes not very descriptive and can make debugging difficult.
